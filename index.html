      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application across the hybrid cloud. A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it. Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient. - sources:https://www.docker.com/what-container https://www.docker.com/what-docker</p>
      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is free and open source software for web serving, reverse proxying and more. - sources:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/</p>
      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination. - sources: 02-CloudComputingFundamentals.pptx.</p>
